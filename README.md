# Snake Game with ML 🐍

Snake game controlled using [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) for image detection.

## Control

- Up: 🙆
- Down:🤜🤛
- Left:✋
- Right: 🤚

## Tools🔨

- ml5.js
- p5.js

## Some notes 😕

- Doesn’t work very well on mobile device, the responsive layout are a bit tricky and the default video play setup of iOS device doesn't work.
- Sometimes doesn't recognize 'right' and takes it as 'up'
- I'm working on making it more intuitive, using **PoseNet** instead of **Classify**, both from ml5.js

# Snake Game with ML

Snake game controlled using (ml5.js)[https://ml5js.org/] for image detection.
CONTROLS: Up: ðŸ™† | Down:ðŸ¤œðŸ¤› | Left:âœ‹ | Right: ðŸ¤š

## ToolsðŸ”¨

- ml5.js
- p5.js

## Some notes ðŸ˜•

- Doesnâ€™t work very well on mobile device, the responsive layout are a bit tricky and the default video play setup of iOS device doesn't work.
- Sometimes doesn't recognize 'right' and takes it as 'up'
- I'm working on making it more intuitive, using **PoseNet** instead of **Classify**, both from ml5.js
